# abordage - the geocaching webapp

abordage is the crate managing things such as caches, user infos etc... It's currently in early alpha and it's not even working yet! (another project that i might finish this time)

This webapp was made with the following crates : [Rocket](https://rocket.rs), [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), and [Dotenvy](https://github.com/nystudio107/dotenvy).

## Installation

Needed : the latest Rust stable chain (you can get it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)) , and a Postgres database server running.

## License

This project is licensed under the GPLv3 licence, bc it was the first i thought of

## TODO

- [ ] Finish implementations of the Cache and users routes
- [ ] Create a docker-compose to make installation easier
